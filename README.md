# RL_microgrid
Bullet points:
1. Microgrid electric model muilding in python (simple load balance)
2. Base station controller logic module building and its interface port with different method. Make it universal.
3. RL method application and modeling. Need specify problem space and learning methid.
4. Add NN controller as comparison?
5. Test with different scenarios.
6. Keep or discard game approach? Performance comparison.

To do lists:
1. A folder containing electric model: base station, renewable power source, battery
2. A folder containing different load planning strategies: constant, global optial(require communicatioin), game approach, self_learning
3. Test environment folder: load and renewable power curve and distibution, stored energy requirement
